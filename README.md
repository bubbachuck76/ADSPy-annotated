# ADSPy-annotated
Annotated Jupyter notebooks (i.e., subtitles &amp; inline graphics) from Applied Data Science with Python specialization on Coursera

The provided notebooks are minimialistic with regards to comments. However, Coursera provides subtitles to their audio lectures which I have integrated into the notebooks along with the slide graphics at the appropriate places. This increases educational utility of the Jupyter notebook.
Jupyter notebooks are available for free on Coursera for anyone who audits a course.
For example, link to downloading notebooks can be found for Course 3 can be found here: https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-machine-learning/resources/bANLa (free login required)
